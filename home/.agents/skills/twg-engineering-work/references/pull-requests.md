# Finding And Reading PRs

Use this reference to find pull requests and read their state, checks, and
review activity. For PR-only status summaries of a person or repository, use
`pr-only-status.md`.

Work in two steps: find the PR set with one list route, then read detail only
for the PRs that change the answer. Repository-scoped Bitbucket commands take
`--workspace <ws> --repo <repo>`. List routes accept
`-o json --output-summary auto --agent-fields <preset>`; use live help for
options not shown here.

## Find PRs

| Starting point                    | Route                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jira issue                        | `twg context jira workitem <KEY> --types ExternalPullRequest` returns PRs linked to or mentioning the issue, grouped by relationship name; only linked PRs belong to the issue. `--since` defaults to `7d`; widen it in days, such as `365d`. |
| Text or key in a repository       | `twg bitbucket pull-requests query <text>` searches titles and descriptions.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| One repository                    | `twg bitbucket pull-requests query` with `--state` (one per call, default `OPEN`), `--author`, `--reviewer`, branch, and created, updated, or merged dates.                                                                                   |
| Person or org across repositories | `twg pull-requests query --scope user` or `--scope org` with `--account-id`, `--role`, `--state`, and date filters. `--only-counts` answers volume questions.                                                                                 |
| Known PR URLs                     | `twg pull-requests get <pr-url...>` returns state, reviewers, approvals, and readable repository links for the whole set in one call. Use it to present PRs found through `context`, which returns UUID-based links.                          |

`twg pull-requests query --state open` and `twg pr-tree --state open` include
draft PRs. Use `twg pull-requests query --state draft` for drafts only.

| Summary, build and check results | `twg bitbucket pull-requests get <id> --statuses`                            |
| Open tasks                       | `twg bitbucket pull-requests task query <id>`                                |
| Review discussion                | `twg bitbucket pull-requests comment query <id>`                             |
| Changed files                    | `twg bitbucket pull-requests diffstat <id>`                                  |
| Line changes                     | `twg bitbucket pull-requests diff <id>`, after diffstat narrows the files    |
| Approval and update timeline     | `twg bitbucket pull-requests activity <id>`; `--type` filters one event kind |

## Native batch evidence

Group selected PR IDs by repository before reading current checks or review history:

```bash
twg bitbucket pull-requests get 930 931 --workspace atlassian --repo twg-cli --statuses --comments --agent-fields @compact
twg bitbucket pull-requests activity 930 931 --workspace atlassian --repo twg-cli --limit 50 --agent-fields @compact
```

Each accepts up to 25 IDs. Options apply to each PR; history limits are per PR.
Batch output retains ordered `items` with `input`, `ok`, and `data` or `error`,
plus `summary` and `partial`. Keep successful evidence when another PR fails;
report failed PRs and failed sub-resource reads. `--batch-concurrency` can lower
parallelism (default/maximum 5); `--strict` returns a failure exit code for
incomplete batches while retaining the results. A single ID keeps its existing
output shape. Use the general `pull-requests get <url...>` when its reviewer and
state evidence already answers the question.
