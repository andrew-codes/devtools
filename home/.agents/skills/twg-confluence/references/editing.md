# Confluence Editing

For any non-trivial body edit, use:

```text
read -> save to file -> edit locally -> update from file -> verify
```

## Safe Workflow

1. Fetch full detail in the intended body format. For edits to classic pages
   (`type=page`), add `--draft` and use that draft body and its returned
   snapshot token. Include
   `--body-only --output-file <path> -o json --include-metadata`. One call
   writes the body to the file and returns the envelope;
   `data.metadata.hasSpaceInstructions` tells you whether a space-instructions
   read is needed (see `spaces.md`).
2. Use the local file at `data.body.outputFile` when present; otherwise save
   `data.body.value` to a local file.
3. Capture the response's snapshot token (`data.snapshotToken`). Without
   `-o json`, `--body-only` output omits it.
4. Modify the file without reconstructing unrelated content.
5. Update with the body file, matching format, and snapshot token; use
   `--dry-run` first only for explicit preview or validation requests, or for
   unusually risky edits where direct execution was not requested.
6. Update `--draft` saves the draft; omit it to publish, according to user intent.
   Read back the result.

HTML is the safest round-trip format for macros and exact storage content.
Markdown is easier for prose but may not preserve every Confluence construct.

Do not replace a long existing body with an inline string unless the user
explicitly intends a complete rewrite. Do not omit optimistic-concurrency
tokens when the command requires them.

For targeted edits, prefer an advertised granular edit operation over rewriting
the entire body. Use inline `--edits` for small payloads and `--edits-file` for
larger, multiline, or sensitive payloads. Title-only changes should not resend
body content.

## Dry Runs and Snapshot Conflicts

- A dry run validates one snapshot; it neither reserves nor refreshes it. For
  body-changing dry runs, add `-o json --output-file <path>` and read
  `data.body.value` for the computed body.
- On a missing, published-base or stale token, refetch the body and token
  (the draft for classic pages, `type=page`), then rebase the
  intended change. Never retry the stale payload with
  `data.currentSnapshot.token`; that defeats the concurrency guard.
- For targeted edits, revalidate targets and anchors against the latest body.
  For full replacement, merge the original, proposed, and latest bodies.
- Stop if a target was deleted, changed incompatibly, or the result is
  ambiguous. Otherwise write promptly with the fresh token and verify.
- If one reconciled retry also becomes stale, report active editing instead of
  looping.
