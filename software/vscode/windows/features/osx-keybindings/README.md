## OSX Keybindings for Windows

When using Windows from a remote desktop client on OSX, this feature will ensure the same shortcuts apply in VS Code in OSX and Windows; e.g., `Cmd+S` will save on both Windows and OSX.

### Troubleshooting

1. Ensure Microsoft Windows PowerToys's Keyboard Manager is enabled.
2. Ensure Left-Windows key is mapped to Left-Ctrl in Keyboard Manager.
