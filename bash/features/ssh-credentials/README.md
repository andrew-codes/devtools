# SSH Environment

Enter your credentials once when starting the shell instance instead of needing to enter them on every git push/pull. Works for multiple SSH keys.

## Setup

Ensure you install [keychain](https://www.funtoo.org/Keychain) via `brew install keychain` or try the [manual download](https://github.com/funtoo/keychain/releases).
